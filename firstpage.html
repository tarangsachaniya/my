I know you might have judged me after yesterday, but, my love, it's just because of the flow and love I have for you. You know that I will never leave you alone, and, yes, physically, basically, mentally, I am yours, my love. You are the epitome of love and happiness for me, the honey to my life. Every time I see myself, I imagine being on your left side, holding my hands, and hearing you say, "Taru Baby, you can do it." I promise you that no matter what happens, I will be with you.<br><hr><br>તુ બધાનો ના વિચારીસ હું, બધાને મનવી લઈસ, બસ તુ મારી સાથે રહ..</p>
